< Field lines of the magnetic field give a qualitative description of the magnetic field in the ISM. We introduce sampling of physical variables along the field lines of the magnetic field, to obtain a quantitative description of the observables. Observables, such as entropy or pulsar RM measures \citep{SSFS02} are frequently used to derive other observables or statistics.  The use of sampling along field lines will enable the analysis of observables across many snapshots, whilst avoiding the use of time averages, which is not sensible for observables associated to a turbulent flow \citep{TL72}. For example, the wavelet transform methods used by Stepanov \textsl{et al} \citep{st02} are used to derive the Galactic magnetic field from pulsar RM data. Field lines of the Galactic magnetic field can be derived from this analysis and it can be further analysed using sampling along the field lines.\\

< Even though the visualisation is informative, it is necessary to determine whether the field lines are sensitive to the phases of the ISM. Consequently, we compare the characteristics of the field lines against straight lines launched in the positive $y$-direction, from the seed points used to compute the field lines. This test is devised using ideas from the field of stereology \citep{BJ04}, lineal analysis in particular. The straight lines used in the test case will have the same general characteristics as the field lines, since they both traverse the computational domain in the positive $y$-direction. This ensures that the lines are representative of the field lines being sampled. Despite having the same general characteristics, the straight lines should not be sensitive to the phases of the ISM; they will not prefer to stay in a particular phase, whilst avoiding others. Therefore, comparison of the PDFs of the observables sampled along the field lines and the straight lines, should identify sensitivity (or lack thereof) of the field lines to the phases of the ISM.\\
< \noindent Figure \vref{fig:pdfs_mean} shows the probability density functions (PDFs) of entropy, log density and log temperature sampled along field lines (solid lines) and straight lines (dashed lines). The PDFs for log density and log temperature suggest that the PDFs have similar overall behaviour, which is most likely due to their alignment in the $y$-direction. This is reassuring since the choice of aligning the straight lines in the $y$-direction was to avoid introducing uncharacteristic behaviour into the comparison. The straight lines have the orientation of the field lines, without the sensitivity to phases.\\
< We now consider the PDFs entropy along the field lines and straight lines in Figure \ref{fig:pdfs_mean}. These PDFs are more rich in information. Firstly, we observe similar peaks in the region $1.66<s<10.365$, which corresponds to the warm phase. This agrees with Figure \vref{fig:fld_lines} in that the field lines do not seem sensitive to the warm phase. \\
